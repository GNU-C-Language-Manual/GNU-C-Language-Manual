<p>The sign of zero is significant, and important, because it records the
creation of a value that is too small to represent, but came from
either the negative axis, or from the positive axis.  Such fine
distinctions are essential for proper handling of <em>branch cuts</em>
in complex arithmetic (see <a href="Complex-Arithmetic.html">Complex Arithmetic</a>).
</p>
<p>The key point about signed zeros is that in comparisons, their sign
does not matter: <code>0.0 == -0.0</code> must <em>always</em> evaluate to
<code>1</code> (true).  However, they are not <em>the same number</em>, and
<code>-0.0</code> in C code stands for a negative zero.
